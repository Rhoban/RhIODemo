# Catkin example package to use RhIO Server

First, you will need to have those packages in your catkin build:

* https://github.com/Rhoban/RhIO
* https://github.com/RhobanDeps/libzmq
* https://github.com/RhobanDeps/jsoncpp

Then you can run the build and have a look at this very simple package that
uses RhIO binding.

The RhIO shell will be compiled by catkin (the "rhio" binary)
